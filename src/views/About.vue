        </b-row>
        <b-row>
          <p>Lovewell Pond is the second largest pond in Fryeburg (Kezar Pond is the largest). It is located in the southern area of Fryeburg just east of the Village. It is maintained by the Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife, and --</p>

            <li>is approximately 1,120 acres in size</li>
            <li>has an elevation of 357 feet above sea level</li>
            <li>has a drainage area calculated at 3,101 acres</li>
            <li>has a maximum depth of 45 feet</li>
            <li>supports a population of brown trout as well as other warmer water species such as smallmouth bass, white perch, yellow perch, pickerel, eels, white sucker, long nose sucker, and hornpout</li>
            <li>has about 75-80 buildings along the shoreline, with approximately 35 others with access rights to the shoreline</li>
            <li>Fight Brook, Mill/Wards Brook, and several smaller unnamed streams flow into the Pond. There is an outlet to the Saco River in the southeastern section of the Pond. There is also a large flood plain in this area along with associated wetlands. Because of these features, Lovewell Pond is subject to flooding when the Saco River Floods. During these floods, the outlet of Lovewell Pond reverses direction and actually flows into the pond.</li>
          </ul>
        </b-row>
        <b-row>
          <p>This flooding phenomenon has caused a delta to form, composed of sands carried in by the flood waters from the sandy bottom of the Saco. Waves help to form sandbars along with these levees. The channel of the outlet meanders through these sand deposits.</p>

        <b-row>
          <p>At the north end of the Pond is an Outwash Plain Pondshore, which is a natural plant community that is critically imperiled in the State Of Maine. Within this plant community are two rare plant species.</p>

        <h1>Loons On Lovewell Pond</h1>
      </b-row>
      <b-row>
        <p>the call of the wild</p>
      </b-row>
      <b-row>
        <p>To many of us, the call of the loon is synonymous with summer on Lovewell Pond. In the 1950's and the 1960's, this wasn't the case. Back then, loons were very rare on Maine's ponds and lakes. The Maine Loon Project was started in 1977 to study the status of the loon population. Thanks to such programs and the public's response, loons ( and eagles) are back on the pond.</p>

        <p>We all love to hear the "call of the loon". Each call means something different in "loonspeak" but to us humans, the sounds translate into "please stay away... enjoy us from afar".</p>

        <p>There are several things we all can do to encourage the loons to stay on our pond and to return each year:</p>
      </b-row>
      <b-row>
        <ul>
          <li>Use only phosphate free detergents and fertilizer</li>
          <li>Enjoy loons from a distance</li>
          <li>While boating, watch for loons and keep your distance</li>
          <li>Slow down if you suspect you are close to diving loons</li>
          <li>Use only lead free fishing sinkers and jigs, and properly dispose of old lead tackle</li>
          <li>Retrieve broken fishing lines</li>
        </ul>

      <b-row>For over 25 years, the Maine Audubon Society has been conducting an annual "Loon Count". Each year, on the third Saturday of July, from 7-7:30 AM, on every lake and pond in Maine, volunteers go out on their lakes and count the loons that they see, marking a special map with the place and time of sighting. Paul Troth was Lovewell Pond's original loon counter. His family (the Gobetz's) have continued the tradition with help from neighbors Stefi Hastings and Colleen Wilkins. The results of 21 years of the loon count on Lovewell Pond are below (updates for 2005-2008 to come, and 2009 when it's available).</b-row>
