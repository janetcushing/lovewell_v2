              <p>Fight Brook, Mill/Wards Brook, and several smaller unnamed streams flow into the Pond. There is an outlet to the Saco River in the southeastern section of the Pond. There is also a large flood plain in this area along with associated wetlands. Because of these features, Lovewell Pond is subject to flooding when the Saco River Floods. During these floods, the outlet of Lovewell Pond reverses direction and actually flows into the pond.</p>
          </b-row>
          <b-row>
            <p>This flooding phenomenon has caused a delta to form, composed of sands carried in by the flood waters from the sandy bottom of the Saco. Waves help to form sandbars along with these levees. The channel of the outlet meanders through these sand deposits.</p>

            <p>At the north end of the Pond is an Outwash Plain Pondshore, which is a natural plant community that is critically imperiled in the State Of Maine. Within this plant community are two rare plant species.</p>

            <p class="table-heading">The Call of the Wild</p>
          </b-row>
          <b-row>
            <p>To many of us, the call of the loon is synonymous with summer on Lovewell Pond. In the 1950's and the 1960's, this wasn't the case. Back then, loons were very rare on Maine's ponds and lakes. The Maine Loon Project was started in 1977 to study the status of the loon population. Thanks to such programs and the public's response, loons ( and eagles) are back on the pond.</p>

            <p>We all love to hear the "call of the loon". Each call means something different in "loonspeak" but to us humans, the sounds translate into "please stay away... enjoy us from afar".</p>

            <p>There are several things we all can do to encourage the loons to stay on our pond and to return each year:</p>

            <p>For over 35 years, the Maine Audubon Society has been conducting an annual "Loon Count". Each year, on the third Saturday of July, from 7-7:30 AM, on every lake and pond in Maine, volunteers go out on their lakes and count the loons that they see, marking a special map with the place and time of sighting. Paul Troth was Lovewell Pond's original loon counter. His family (the Gobetz's) continued the tradition for many years with help from neighbors Stefi Hastings and Colleen Wilkins.  Currently Madeline and Barry Friedman manage the loon count, with help from Colleen and Peter Wilkins. They compile all the data and send it off to the Maine Audubon Society.This makes for a great morning, and we would love to share the experience with others, particularly children.  Please <a href="mailto:lovewellpondassoc@gmail.com" target="_blank">Contact Us</a>, if you want to help with the loon count.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Pequawket" target="_blank">The battle at Pigwacket, commonly called "Lovewell's Fight"</a> after Capt. John Lovewell of Dunstable who commanded the company of 46 colonists, took place on 8 May 1725 on the shores of what is now Lovewell's Pond in Fryeburg, Maine. Lovewell's company went to suppress the Indians in the region and hoped to collect bounties on Indian scalps, but instead was ambushed and Lovewell himself and eight of his soldiers were killed. Lovewell's Fight was famous throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, and much was written about it. Green's <i>Indian Wars</i> gives a comprehensive history of the Fight; Longfellow and others commemorated the Fight in verse.</p>
